## Functions
### `result`
```js
ddg.result(query)
```
This function looks up `query` and returns a `Promise` with one argument. If a result was found, the promise resolves with a `ResultResolveType`

If no result was found, the function is rejected.

**Example**
```js
ddg.result("DuckDuckGo").then(function(res) {
  console.log(res.text);
}).catch(function() {
  console.error("There was an error.");
});
```
### `rawAPI`
```js
ddg.rawAPI(query)
```
This is the internal function used by the library. It sends a JSONP request and returns a `Promise` with the corresponding JSON data.

**Example**
```js
ddg.rawAPI(query).then(function(json) {
  console.log(json);
});
```

## Types
None of these are actually types, they just represent what functions return.

Internationalization is the process of designing a software application so that it can potentially be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. Localization is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by adding locale-specific components and translating text. Localization uses the infrastructure or flexibility provided by internationalization.",
