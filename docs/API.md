### `result`
```js
ddg.result(query)
```
This function looks up `query` and returns a `Promise` with one argument. The argument is described below, as the `res` object. If no result was found, the function is rejected.

**Example**
```js
ddg.result("DuckDuckGo").then(function(res) {
  console.log(res.text);
}).catch(function() {
  console.error("There was an error.");
});
```
### `rawAPI`
```js
ddg.rawAPI(query)
```

**Example**
```js
ddg.rawAPI(query).then(function(json) {
  console.log(json);
});
```

Localization uses the infrastructure or flexibility provided by internationalization.",
